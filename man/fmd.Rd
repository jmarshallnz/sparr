\title{Veterinary foot-and-mouth disease outbreak data}
\format{\code{fmd} is a named list with four members:
\describe{
\item{\code{$cases}}{
An object of class \code{\link[spatstat]{ppp}} giving the spatial locations of the 410 infected
farms within a polygonal study region representing the county of Cumbria. The \code{\link[spatstat]{marks}}
component of this object contain the integer day of infection (from beginning of study period).
}

\item{\code{$controls}}{
An object of class \code{\link[spatstat]{ppp}} defined over the same spatial study region with the locations
of the 1176 uninfected farms.
}

\item{\code{$cases.size}}{
A numeric vector of length 410 giving the size of each infected farm in \code{$cases} as the total animal population.
}

\item{\code{$controls.size}}{
As above, for the uninfected farms.
}

\description{
Data of the spatial locations and time of farms infected by veterinary foot-and-mouth disease
in the county of Cumbria, UK, over a course of nearly 250 days between February and August in 2001.
There are 410 infected farms (the cases), and 1176 uninfected farms (the controls). The data
have been jittered and randomly thinned by an unspecified amount to preserve anonymity.
