\title{Slicing a multi-scale density/intensity object}
\usage{
multiscale.slice(msob, h0, checkargs = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{msob}{An object of class \code{"\link{msden}"} giving the multi-scale
estimate from which to take a slice.}

\item{h0}{Desired global bandwidth; the density/intensity estimate
corresponding to which will be returned. This value \bold{must} be in the
available range provided by \code{msob$h0range}; see `Details'.}

\item{checkargs}{Logical value indicating whether to check validity of
\code{msob} and \code{h0}. Disable only if you know this check will be
unnecessary.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{bivden}} with components
corresponding to the requested slice at \code{h0}. Note that this object
will have the component \code{fromms} set to \code{TRUE}.
}
\description{
Takes a slice of the multi-scale density/intensity estimate at a desired
global bandwidth
}
\details{
Davies & Baddeley (2017) demonstrate that once a multi-scale
density/intensity estimate has been computed, we may take slices parallel to
the spatial domain of the trivariate convolution to return the estimate at
any desired global bandwidth. This function is the implementation thereof
based on a multi-scale estimate resulting from a call to
\code{\link{multiscale.density}}.

The function returns an error (unless \code{checkargs = FALSE}) if the
requested slice at \code{h0} is not within the available range of
pre-computed global bandwidth scalings as defined by the \code{h0range}
component of \code{msob}.

Because the contents of the \code{msob} argument, an object of class
\code{\link{msden}}, are returned based on a discretised set of global
bandwidth scalings, the function internally computes the desired surface as
a pixel-by-pixel linear interpolation using the two discretised global
bandwidth rescalings that bound the requested \code{h0}. (Thus, numeric
accuracy of the slices is improved with an increase to the \code{dimz}
argument of the preceding call to \code{multiscale.density} at the cost of
additional computing time.)
